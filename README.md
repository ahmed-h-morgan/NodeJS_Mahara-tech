# Mahara-Tech NodeJS Course Projects

This repository is a collection of projects I developed while completing the NodeJS course at Mahara-Tech. Each project demonstrates skills in building scalable, back-end services using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, covering core course topics such as:

*   Building RESTful APIs
*   Handling CRUD operations
*   Structuring Express applications
*   Implementing authentication and authorization
*   Working with MongoDB and Mongoose

Each project is contained within its own directory. Feel free to explore the code!
